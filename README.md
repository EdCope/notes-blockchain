# Notes on the Blockchain

Learning to interact with simple data on a blockchain. 

## Installation

Install Truffle globally ```npm i -g truffle```
Install MetaMask extension (tested in version 10.14.6) in Chrome for using with a wallet otherwise it will rely on the local blockchain.

## Testing

To test the solidity contract write `truffle test` in the project folder.

## Run
`npm run start` starts a express server to interact with the blockchain.

`npm run bc` launch a local blockchain.

In truffle develop run ```migrate -reset``` to recompile changes to contracts.
